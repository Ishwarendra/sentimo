## About Sentimo 
**Sentimo is a web-application in which the user can write their daily diary on the basis of experiences and emotions.**

**Our application would recognise the emotion of the user who has either typed notes in his diary or has recorded their own speech and entered in the diary.** 

**Further, Sentimo would recommend certain blogs or movies, based on the user's emotions.**
